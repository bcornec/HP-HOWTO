OpenBSD R5.6/amd64 is running on DL3`6`0 Gen9/P440`ar` on my desk with no
hassle.
I can see all CPUs, memory and bgeX.  Be sure x2apic is OFF for recognition of
all CPUs.
But, local USB-keyboard cannot work.  So you need to use iLO4/Remote Console
or TEXTCONS for keyboard.
On-board SATA control must be AHCI mode, not Legacy/ATA mode for internal DVD
drive use.
And, no X.org cannot start...

I recommend R5.7 for Gen9.  This configuration is fine with local
USB-keyboard.
